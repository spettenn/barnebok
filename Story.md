Ok hello there, i am making a childs story book, i dont really know how long or what format but i think
im just going to write down some notes here(it is in norwegian, so i guess the notes are going to be in norwegian):
I want the book to be mostly for hte age group of 4 to 8 years old, but i want it to be a book that can be read by
ayone. I want it to be a book that is easy to read and understand, but i also want it to be a book that is fun to read
for adults. the book is based on a cat in teh neighborhood that always escapes and explore, the cat is called Tassen.
The cat is the main funny part of the local facebook group.
In the future i want to make it a website with a series of the the book and make it easy for people to consume it.
